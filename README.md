# Discord Bot for Poly Study Group

## Description
A discord bot for our study group. Really more of an exercise in running some python in a group setting.

## Hosting
I have got a digital ocean droplet running for some side projects. Happy to run it there. Maybe we can migrate to docker since that's running on the droplet.
